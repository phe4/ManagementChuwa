## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer. Version 18 or newer should work.
2. Make sure you have a code editor and a command line.
3. Open the root folder of this project in your editor.
4. Install the additional libraries this project needs by running `npm install` on the command line.

## How to Run
Start the server by running `npm run dev` (your editor may also display a â–¶ button next to the same command in package.json).
The server will automatically listen for requests on port 5173. Go to (http://localhost:5173/) in your browser and
you should be able to see the website.
